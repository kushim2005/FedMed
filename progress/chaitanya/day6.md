# Chaitanya Day 6 - fix(model): fix ConvTranspose3D output padding issue and verify on full BraTS volume

## Tasks Completed
* Debugged a dimension mismatch issue in the `ConvTranspose3D` layers.
* Adjusted the output padding to ensure the decoder output exactly matches the `(240, 240, 155)` original BraTS resolution.
* Validated on a full-sized sample.

## Notes & Challenges
* Spatial dimension mismatch was causing concatenation errors in the skip connections. Fixed now.
